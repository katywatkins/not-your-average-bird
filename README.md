# Not Your Average Bird

A small website (about penguins!) that started out as a learning opportunity for myself, and is now a learning opportunity for a friend!

## Requirements:
- Node.js

Run `node --version` in your terminal to check whether or not it's installed. If it returns something like `v16.13.0`, you're good to go.

## Running Locally
Run the following commands in your terminal.
- `npm install`
- `npm run start`

This should open up a browser window that displays the site running on localhost:3000. It should update automatically when you make changes.
